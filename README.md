# PORTAL AngoDev
Portal Ango Dev is an open source angolan software development website created for developers in the Angolan Software community.

## Dependencies
These are the Dependencies this project relies on, any dependency updates should be reflected here as well.
We do not use any PHP frameworks what so ever but we do use libraries or modules from frameworks where necessary.

1. PHP 5.6.x (Why not PHP 7x you ask? Not all hosting services support it and those who do have bugs. )
2. Illuminate - The Illuminate Database component is a full database toolkit for PHP, providing an expressive query builder, ActiveRecord               style ORM, and schema builder. [Illuminate](https://github.com/illuminate/database)
